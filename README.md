Filter logic for API Platform
=============================
Combines existing API Platform ORM Filters with AND, OR and NOT according to client request.
- supports nested logic (parentheses)
- supports multiple criteria for the same property
- existing requests keep working unmodified if not using "and", "or" or "not" as query parameters

Usage
-----
Once the FilterLogic class and service configuration have been installed in you app,
just add it as the last ApiFilter annotation. Then make a request with filter parameters nested in and/or in the query string.

For example if you have:
```php8
#[ApiResource]
#[ApiFilter(SearchFilter::class, properties: ['id' => 'exact', 'price' => 'exact', 'description' => 'partial'])]
#[ApiFilter(FilterLogic::class)]
class Offer {
// ...
}
```
Callling the collection get operation with:
```uri
/offers/?or[price]=10&or[description]=shirt
```
will return all offers with a price being exactly 10 OR a description containing the word "shirt".

NOT expressions are combined like the other expressions trough the compound logic (and, or) they are nested in:  
```uri
/offers/?or[not][price]=10&or[not][description]=shirt 
```
will return (all offers with a price not being 10) OR (a description NOT containing the word "shirt").
If they are not nested in compound logic AND is used:

```uri
/offers/?price=10&not[description]=shirt
```
will return all offers with a price being exactly 10 AND a description NOT containing the word "shirt".
This is different from the other expressions which are combined by the filters themselves.

You can have nested logic and multiple criteria for the same property like this:
```uri
/offers/?and[price]=10&and[or][][description]=shirt&and[or][][description]=cotton
```
The api will return all offers with a price being exactly 10 AND (a description containing the word "shirt" OR the word "cotton").
Because of the nesting of or the criteria for the description are combined together through
AND with the criterium for price, which must allways be true while only one of the
criteria for the desciption needs to be true for an order to be returned.

Installation
------------
With composer:
```shell
composer require metaclass-nl/filter-bundle "dev-master"
```

Then add the bundle to your api config/bundles.php:
```php
    // (...)
    Metaclass\FilterBundle\MetaclassFilterBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```

Limitations
-----------
Combining filters through OR and nested logic may be a harder task for your
database and require different indexes. Except for small tables performance
testing and analysis is advisable prior to deployment.  

Only works with filters implementing ContextAwareFilterInterface, other filters
are ignoored. Works with built in filters of Api Platform, except for DateFilter 
with EXCLUDE_NULL. A DateFilter subclass is provided to correct this.

Assumes that filters create semantically complete expressions in the sense that
expressions added to the QueryBundle through ::andWhere or ::orWhere do not depend
on one another so that the intended logic is not compromised if they are recombined
with the others by either Doctrine\ORM\Query\Expr\Andx or Doctrine\ORM\Query\Expr\Orx.

May Fail if a filter uses QueryBuilder::where or ::add.

You are advised to check the code of all custom and third party Filters and
not to combine those that use QueryBuilder::where or ::add with FilterLogic
or that produce complex logic that is not semantically complete. For an
example of semantically complete and incomplete expressions see [DateFilterTest](./tests/Filter/DateFilterTest.php).

You can in/exclude filters by class name by configuring classExp. For example:
```php docblock
* @ApiFilter(FilterLogic::class, arguments={"classExp"="/ApiPlatform\\Core\\Bridge\\Doctrine\\Orm\\Filter\\+/"})
```
will only apply API Platform ORM Filters in logic context.
